Why is this topic important for ne
	First encounter with the Messiah
		Aan mijn denken, groei
		Humbled myself for having the truth and the understanding easily

How does the world sees Easter now
What is easter – wikipedia

Error Easter
	Is the name an error
	How is it linked with the Meesiah
	They call easter for the “whole three days” – which three days? Vriday – Monday ..
	
We switch from easter to passover, but what is the easter in kvj and what is the context about it.
Luke wrote acts, what is zijn schrijfstijl in Luke 22


Let's look at the old testament, what is passover
	Exodus 12
	Levitus 23
	Numbers 9
	deutronomy 16


How can we say passover on the ressurection if he is the passover lamb?
	John 1:29
	1 Corinthians 5:7

How did the last days of the Messiah go?
	What did they say about his death:
		talking about himself:
			Matthew 12:
		Example of others speaking
			(‭Matthew‬ ‭26‬:‭61‬ KJV)
			Not messiah himself, this was the phearaseas speaking
			1 Corinthians 15:4
	Meal:
		
	Crusifixion:
		Matthew 27:41

	Took his body:
		Took his body from the cross, because of the High Sabbath – John 19:31
		->
		Mark 15:42 → link with the old testament.

	First visit:
		Not allowed to check on the Sabbath, which is Saterday – Matt 28:1, Mark 26:1

Backwards calculation:
	ninth hour ->

Day Error
	How can easter be inline with the “ressurection day” if, you know the old testament feast, that is is the passover lab etc
	Root word of Easter – The Same, so it cannot be bad, but the day we call it is bad..
	Introduction to Ishtar
	Calling Easter, Pascha etc for the upstanding. That will be the link to Isthar, the birth of new season, the “upstanding”. Concil of nicea
	They are aware of the change – Council of Nicea
	You can't call the upstanding easter/pascha
		That is evil And relates more to the Ishtar
	
	
Which day did he Died


Why does the feast Matters
	Mark‬ ‭7‬:‭6-8
