The plague in the times of Egypt, was to kill the first born. In Egypt is did so
- Where the lamp first born (or it first year enough)
- Y'shua was therefor the first born. Elohim never sended his first real born. therefor since that day it stopped (Just as Egypt offered their first born and you never hear about them any more.)
