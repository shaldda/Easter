# Easter
There a lot of things pointed out about the true histroy of Easter
- People says it's derrived from Isthar, also know als Astheroth
- Others says it's derrived from the German word Ostern.

In both cases, we can all conclude that is have pagan elements in it. 
Who can we blame for this and why did they do that?
- Counsil of nicea
	- They did it because it's about the survival of the fittest. You cannot control a population if there's a lot of domination etc.
